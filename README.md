# Vernam-Cipher-With-C
This project builds on my previous encryption project with XOR but now implements a Vernam cipher encryption method in C, offering a more secure alternative. The cipher uses a one-time pad where each input character is XORed with a unique character from the provided key. This ensures the encryption is highly secure and essentially unbreakable.
